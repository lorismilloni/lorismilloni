#### Current works
* I'm currently working on learning to :bricks: use **OOP** to build a **CRUD API** to manage a car shop :car:.
#### :zap: Quick Facts
* I'm licentiated in Portuguese Literature, but last year, one day after my graduation, I thought there was still time to pursuit a career in tech
* I bought a book and started learning Python, with little success
* Very determinated, I started making a career change from Literature to Code and then I got into Trybe (a school of web development)
* In Trybe I started developing web sites and then I finally understood what I was doing
* I have used Linux as main system my whole life, and I look for an open source future
