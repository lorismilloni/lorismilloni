#### Current works
* I'm currently working on building :bricks: **web sites using JavaScript** and working up on polishing my skills ðŸŒ± in **Refactoring**.
* Getting started with Node.js!
#### :zap: Quick Facts
* I've started learning programming skills to have a Raspberry Pi with of old games, but I've never bought one
* I'm licentiated in Portuguese Literature, but one day after graduated last year, I thought there was still time to pursuit a career in coding
* I bought a book and started learning Python, with little success
* Very determinated, I started transitiong my career from Literature to Code and I got into Trybe (a school of web development)
* In Trybe I started developing web sites and then I finally understood what I was doing
* I have used Linux as main system my whole life, and I look for an open source future
* Soon as I finish Trybe in october, I'll dive deep into Ruby, the language designed for programmer happiness
* And now that I know what I'm doing I want to try Python again
